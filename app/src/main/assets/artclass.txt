Tell Nicholas to stop. If he doesn't, call the teacher.
Perfect! It's good to have an adult help out to fix something. But you should  try to fix it first. Then call an adult if that doesn't work.

Call the teacher.

artclass3
Do nothing.
Not quite. When you see something that isn't right, you should do something about it. Nicholas is being mean to Kevin, which isn't right. Try again.
